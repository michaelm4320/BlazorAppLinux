# Blazor Application
This is a Blazor web app building with ASP.NET on Linux.

ASP is a server-side scripting technology used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. 

.NET is a software development framework that is designed to provide an environment for building and running applications and supports multiple programming languages, such as C#.

# How it works
First to create the app you must run the command 'dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp' on the terminal. This will create a directory and it's content.

To build and start the app you must run the command 'dotnet watch' on the terminal. It will begin listening http://localhost:<port number> and then open a browser and navigate to that address.

The page will display the Home.razor file located under the Components/Page directory along with it's contents.
